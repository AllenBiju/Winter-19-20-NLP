Low expectations It is relatively easy to write computer programs without using
software engineering methods and techniques. Many companies have drifted
into software development as their products and services have evolved. They do
not use software engineering methods in their everyday work. Consequently,
their software is often more expensive and less reliable than it should be. We
need better software engineering education and training to address this problem.
