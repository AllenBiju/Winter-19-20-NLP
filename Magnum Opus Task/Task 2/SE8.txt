Software engineering is intended to support professional software development,
rather than individual programming. It includes techniques that support program
specification, design, and evolution, none of which are normally relevant for personal
software development. To help you to get a broad view of what software engineering
is about, I have summarized some frequently asked questions in Figure 1.1.
Many people think that software is simply another word for computer programs.
However, when we are talking about software engineering, software is not just the
programs themselves but also all associated documentation and configuration data
that is required to make these programs operate correctly. A professionally developed
software system is often more than a single program. The system usually consists
of a number of separate programs and configuration files that are used to set up
these programs. It may include system documentation, which describes the structure
of the system; user documentation, which explains how to use the system, and websites
for users to download recent product information.
