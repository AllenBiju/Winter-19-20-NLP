This is one of the important differences between professional and amateur software
development. If you are writing a program for yourself, no one else will use it
and you don’t have to worry about writing program guides, documenting the program
design, etc. However, if you are writing software that other people will use and
other engineers will change then you usually have to provide additional information
as well as the code of the program.
