Increasing demands As new software engineering techniques help us to build
larger, more complex systems, the demands change. Systems have to be built
and delivered more quickly; larger, even more complex systems are required;
systems have to have new capabilities that were previously thought to be impossible.
Existing software engineering methods cannot cope and new software
engineering techniques have to be developed to meet new these new demands.
