Software engineers can be rightly proud of their achievements. Of course we still
have problems developing complex software but, without software engineering, we
would not have explored space, would not have the Internet or modern telecommunications.
All forms of travel would be more dangerous and expensive. Software engineering
has contributed a great deal and I am convinced that its contributions in the
21st century will be even greater.
