Lots of people write programs. People in business write spreadsheet programs to
simplify their jobs, scientists and engineers write programs to process their experimental
data, and hobbyists write programs for their own interest and enjoyment.
However, the vast majority of software development is a professional activity where
software is developed for specific business purposes, for inclusion in other devices,
or as software products such as information systems, CAD systems, etc. Professional
software, intended for use by someone apart from its developer, is usually developed
by teams rather than individuals. It is maintained and changed throughout its life.
