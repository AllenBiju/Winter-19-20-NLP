There are many different types of software systems, from simple embedded systems
to complex, worldwide information systems. It is pointless to look for universal
notations, methods, or techniques for software engineering because different types
of software require different approaches. Developing an organizational information
system is completely different from developing a controller for a scientific instrument.
Neither of these systems has much in common with a graphics-intensive computer
game. All of these applications need software engineering; they do not all need
the same software engineering techniques.
