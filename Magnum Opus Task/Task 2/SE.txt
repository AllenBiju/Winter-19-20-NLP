We can’t run the modern world without software. National infrastructures and utilities
are controlled by computer-based systems and most electrical products include a
computer and controlling software. Industrial manufacturing and distribution is
completely computerized, as is the financial system. Entertainment, including the
music industry, computer games, and film and television, is software intensive.
Therefore, software engineering is essential for the functioning of national and international
societies.
