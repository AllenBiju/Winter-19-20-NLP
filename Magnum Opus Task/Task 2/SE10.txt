An important difference between these types of software is that, in generic products,
the organization that develops the software controls the software specification. For custom
products, the specification is usually developed and controlled by the organization
that is buying the software. The software developers must work to that specification.
However, the distinction between these system product types is becoming
increasingly blurred. More and more systems are now being built with a generic
product as a base, which is then adapted to suit the requirements of a customer.
Enterprise Resource Planning systems, such as the SAP system, are the best
examples of this approach. Here, a large and complex system is adapted for a company
by incorporating information about business rules and processes, reports
required, and so on.
