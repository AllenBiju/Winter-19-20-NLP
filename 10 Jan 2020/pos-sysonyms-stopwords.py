His ears are turned back while his noble looking head is held high. His all black coat 
glistens in the late afternoon sun. His face displays a strong confidence with his 
nostrils flared, his veins bulging from his cheek bones, and his fiery black eyes burning holes 
into the souls of those who stare into them. His neck muscles are tensed and thickened with adrenalin. 
His black main is thrown into the wind like a flag rippling in the winds of a tornado. His muscular front legs are 
brought up to his chest displaying his flashing gray hooves that could crush a man's scull with one blow. His backbone and 
underbelly are held almost straight up and his hind quarters are tensed. His back legs are spread apart for balance. His 
back hooves are pressed into the earth; therefore, his hooves cause deep gouges from the weight of his body on the soil. 
His black tail is held straight down and every once in a while a burst of wind catches it and then it floats down back into
place like an elegant piece of silk falling from the sky. His bravery and strength are what made his breed prized as a warhorse."""]
