# Orthography – 
# At its most basic, an orthography is a standardized system of writing. 
# It's the collection of rules that lets us visually represent a language. 
# This starts with creating the symbols upon which a written language is built. 
# Example – logographic orthography uses use symbols to represent entire words or ideas.

# Suprasegmental
# Suprasegmental features are speech features that describe phonetic features. 
# They describe the way a word is pronounced. 
# They have features such as stress, tone, or word juncture over particular words, phrases or syllables.

# Typographic Features –
# Typographic features are the visual features of the font of a particular language. 
# These features are used to make the words more legible, readable and appealing. 
# The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing (leading), and letter-spacing (tracking), and adjusting the space between pairs of letters.
